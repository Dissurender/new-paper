## Exploring local cache implementation with Go

Getting started with this program I had the goal of ingesting the data from [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) created by [ycombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) and providing a fully fetched comment tree upon querying a story.

## Table of Contents

## Write-up

Two, that the documentation for said API linked in the footer of [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) is not entirely straight foward.. I actually found another version of documentation that was more useful [Hackernews.api-docs.io](https://hackernews.api-docs.io/v0/overview/introduction) that had more information on what to expect from fetching data.
